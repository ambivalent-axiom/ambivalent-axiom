## Hi there üëã

Thanks for visiting my sapce! I appreciate.

You are reading this readme instead of talking to me directly probably because I am superbusy working on my CODELEX final project, it's going to be full functional banking system... can't wait to push it.. üê±

If You wanna check my best projects, check:

MVC and OOP in web examples in PHP:
Article Website: https://github.com/ambivalent-axiom/articleWebsite or Crypto Trade https://github.com/ambivalent-axiom/crypto_trade

This one is deployed on https://ambax.io
I know, it's procedural, but You can see that I know those fundamentals too, not just Laravel. :)))
